Conflict Resolution
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
Communicate and don’t work without the other person present (depending on the remaining work load). Assume good intentions.
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
IF one person understand a concept more, then explain it to the other! Don’t take things personally.
